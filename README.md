We created a project called Maze Runner. 

Maze Runner is a locally hosted game where the goal of the game is for the player to finish a maze while racing an AI.  Our game makes use of a database where players must first register for an account and then they can login, save their scores, and see how well they rank against other players within the database.  The database includes the players and their scores and times for how long it took to complete each maze.  For the maze itself there are difficulty settings: easy, medium, and hard.  The AI is a non-dynamically created AI, given that the processing time and the host could not maintain such a processing task.  Instead the AI is the best of its generation after the code has run multiple times locally.  We saved that data and implemented it within the website so that racing against the AI was a challenge rather than the AI trying to learn the maze and the player had already won by that time.  Also on our website we have an A* algorithm demonstration which enables the player to learn more about AI and understand a different approach than our own, for solving a maze. 

The repo is structured alphabetically and it includes all of our updates throughout the semester and what we've been working on.
