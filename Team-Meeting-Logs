Team Meeting Logs

02/04/2020
Met in Norlin Library. Discussed project idea. Agreed on AI maze.  Worked on project milestone 1. 
Reviewed and discussed requirements and expectations for project. 

02/13/2020
Met in Engineering Center. Worked on project milestone 2, talked about six features of the project. Discussed who was doing what.

02/18/2020
Met in Norlin Library.  Started implementation on website with login and password as well as simple maze generation.

02/25/2020
Met in Norlin Library.  Looked at the beginnings of our AI generation.  Worked with git to upload.

03/04/2020
Met in Engineering Center.  Worked on tackling the maze generation for our AI.
  We had some difficulties with a local optimum being essentially a dead end, so we had to tackle this issue.  
  Talked about random clusters, path finding, generation cluster bursts, and different generations going different ways,
  Increased fitness for surrounding nodes. Corners hard, brain hurt. Not good.
  Also discussed about implementing the user based moves, so we could start working on the other aspects of this process.

03/10/2020
Met in Engineering Center.  Figured out a pattern for how to update fitness. 
  Need a function to update essentially the 2D array with the fitness scores. This allows for it to explore unvisited paths 
  (which helps solve our distance fitness problem). 
  Global 2D array so we can populate obstacles and fitness as well as a boolean array for the user input. 
  Need a function for obstacleVisited/ nodeVisited to help update fitness.  
  
03/17/2020
Met on Zoom.  Was a little rough, considering everything going on this week.  Decided log-in and scores will go into our database.  

03/31/2020
Met on Zoom.  Discussed new implementations for our AI algorithm.  
  At this point Naomi has done player control, Ben and Daniel have been working on AI generation.
  Daniel has also worked on the obstacles and visual aspects of the maze.
  Mehdi and Jeff have been working on the front and back end, getting our webpage up and running as well as logins for our users.
  Corey has been working on our A* algorithm and how to implement it.
  Other things to note- we have run into quite a lot of problems with the AI and edge cases. 
  Worked on project milestone 5.
